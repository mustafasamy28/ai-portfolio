        "I've worked on several exciting projects! My main ones include:\n\n**AI Trading System** - An autonomous multi-agent trading platform with 4 AI traders using different investment strategies (value, macro, systematic, crypto). They manage $10K portfolios and execute 100+ trades daily with full audit trails.\n\n**Intelligent FAQ Assistant with RAG** - A production RAG system that handles 5,000+ queries daily with 92% accuracy. It reduced customer support costs by $250K annually and achieved 4.7/5 user satisfaction.\n\n**House Price Prediction System** - An ML pipeline achieving 92% prediction accuracy with $15K average error on $300K+ properties, processing valuations in under 2 seconds.\n\nWould you like details on any specific project?",
        "I specialize in building production-ready AI and ML systems. My standout projects include:\n\n• **AI Trading System** - Multi-agent platform with autonomous traders\n• **RAG FAQ Assistant** - Enterprise-grade knowledge system handling 5K+ daily queries\n• **House Price Prediction** - ML model with 92% accuracy for real estate valuation\n\nEach project demonstrates end-to-end development from data to deployment.
